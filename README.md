# AYN

AYN application combines image recognition technologies with human input to provide different sources of image descriptions for Twitter. 
Previous studies and the survey published for this category confirmed that they lack an image description assistant application that supports Arabic speakers well. Therefore, the AYN application relies on describing images posted on Twitter using artificial intelligence through text and voice in Arabic. 
To improve the overall quality of image descriptions and to support AI descriptions, AYN allows additional descriptions to be added by sighted volunteers registered in the application.

The system will receive the image link from Twitter, then describe the image and translate it into Arabic, and finally, read the description of the image by a screen reader. The user can view the additional description that the volunteer shared, in addition to the ability to re-hear the description more than once.
